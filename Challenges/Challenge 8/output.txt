The Loss (a measure of error) steadily decreases, showing the network is learning.
The final predictions are very close to the expected outputs: values near 0 for an expected output of 0, and values near 1 for an expected output of 1.

This successfully solves the challenge and demonstrates the fundamental principle behind why deep neural networks are so powerful
