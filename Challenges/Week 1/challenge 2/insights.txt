Some insights from Crutchfield, Ditto, and Sinha’s introduction to the Focus Issue on “Intrinsic and Designed Computation”:

1. **Computation Beyond Transistors**
   The paper argues that useful information processing isn’t confined to silicon-based, Boolean logic circuits—nonlinear dynamical systems, including chaotic maps, intrinsically store, transform, and transmit information in richer ways than standard digital gates

2. **Bridging Foundational Disciplines**
   Understanding computation in dynamical systems unites dynamical‐systems theory, probability, mathematical logic, communication theory, and theoretical computer science—disciplines that originally grew from the same conceptual roots

3. **Challenging “Digital Hegemony”**
   Our entrenched belief that only deterministic, von-Neumann architectures count as “real” computers is questioned. The authors call this the “digital hegemony” and invite us to explore alternative substrates

4. **Eclectic Range of Approaches**
   The Focus Issue spans work from the most abstract—where even deciding if a system is chaotic can be as hard as solving major mathematical problems—to concrete implementations of “chaotic logic” in software and hardware 

5. **Harnessing Chaos as Logic (“Chaogates”)**
   Several contributions explore how sensitive dependence on initial conditions can be engineered into logic primitives, turning chaos itself into a computational resource 

6. **Reservoir Computing Paradigms**
   Recurrent dynamical systems—whether neural, photonic, or chemical—can serve as “reservoirs” that map inputs into high-dimensional state spaces, where simple linear readouts extract complex temporal patterns 

7. **Designed Self-Organizing Materials**
   The issue highlights efforts to embed computation within the material’s own physics—creating meta-materials whose self-organization and phase transitions perform information processing 

8. **Energy Efficiency and Robustness**
   Intrinsic computation promises hardware that is inherently parallel, noise-tolerant, and far more energy-efficient than ever-shrinking CMOS transistors, potentially postponing or sidestepping the end of Moore’s Law ([ResearchGate][2]).

9. **Reframing “What Is Computation?”**
   By recognizing pattern formation, adaptation, and information flows in nature as computational acts, the authors push us to a broader, more philosophical understanding of computation itself

10. **Ubiquity of Natural Information Processing**
    Perhaps the most lasting legacy will be an appreciation that computation pervades the natural world—from chemical oscillations to ecological networks—and that harnessing these processes could revolutionize how we build computers
