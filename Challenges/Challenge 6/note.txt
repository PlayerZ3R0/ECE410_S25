A Note on the "Perceptron Learning Rule"
The request mentions using the "perceptron learning rule" with a sigmoid function. It's important to clarify a key distinction:

The classic Perceptron Learning Rule was designed for a neuron with a step function as its activator. It updates weights based on a simple error term.
A neuron with a smooth, differentiable activation function like the sigmoid function is typically trained using gradient descent. This method uses the derivative (gradient) of the activation function to make more nuanced weight adjustments.
For this solution, we will follow the spirit of the challenge by implementing a neuron with a sigmoid function and training it with the appropriate method: gradient descent. This is the foundational technique for modern neural networks.
